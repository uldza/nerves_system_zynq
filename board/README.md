Digilent Zybo
=============

This is the Buildroot board support for the Digilent Zybo. The Zybo is
a development board based on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 based All-Programmable
System-On-Chip.

Zybo information including schematics, reference designs, and manuals are
available from http://store.digilentinc.com/zybo-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-trainer-board/ .

If you want a custom FPGA bitstream to be loaded by U-Boot, copy it as
